# NS-3-ALIBABACLOUD

This repository contains an NS3-based network simulator that acts as a network backend for [SimAI](https://github.com/aliyun/SimAI).

We have release a new dev branch featuring the following enhancements in [**dev/qp**](https://github.com/aliyun/ns-3-alibabacloud/tree/dev/qp):
1. **QP Logic Support**: Enables creation and destruction of QPs based on actual RDMA logic, allowing multiple messages to be carried by a pair of QPs.
2. **NIC CC Configuration**: Supports perIP or perQP settings for enhanced flexibility.
3. **Optimized Scheduling Logic**: Adheres to the Max-Min principle, resolving issues of underutilization and unfairness in network resource allocation.
4. **Decoupling of the CC Module**: For improved modularity and efficiency.

Thank [**@MXtremist**](https://github.com/MXtremist) for contributing to this feature.
